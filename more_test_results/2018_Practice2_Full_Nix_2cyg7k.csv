Mozilla Firefox is an open source web browser. XULRunner provides the
XUL Runtime environment for Mozilla Firefox.

Several flaws were found in the processing of malformed web content. A
web page containing malicious content could cause Firefox to crash or,
potentially, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running Firefox. (CVE-2015-0813, CVE-2015-0815, CVE-2015-0801)

A flaw was found in the way documents were loaded via resource URLs
in, for example, Mozilla's PDF.js PDF file viewer. An attacker could
use this flaw to bypass certain restrictions and under certain
conditions even execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running Firefox. (CVE-2015-0816)

A flaw was found in the Beacon interface implementation in Firefox. A
web page containing malicious content could allow a remote attacker to
conduct a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. (CVE-2015-0807)

Red Hat would like to thank the Mozilla project for reporting these
issues. Upstream acknowledges Christian Holler, Byron Campen, Steve
Fink, Mariusz Mlynski, Christoph Kerschbaumer, Muneaki Nishimura, Olli
Pettay, Boris Zbarsky, and Aki Helin as the original reporters of
these issues.

All Firefox users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain Firefox version 31.6.0 ESR, which corrects these issues. After

Kerberos is a networked authentication system which allows clients and
servers to authenticate to each other with the help of a trusted third
party, the Kerberos KDC.

The following security issues are fixed with this release :

A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the MIT Kerberos
libgssapi_krb5 library processed valid context deletion tokens. An
attacker able to make an application using the GSS-API library
(libgssapi) could call the gss_process_context_token() function and
use this flaw to crash that application. (CVE-2014-5352)

If kadmind were used with an LDAP back end for the KDC database, a
remote, authenticated attacker who has the permissions to set the
password policy could crash kadmind by attempting to use a named
ticket policy object as a password policy for a principal.
(CVE-2014-5353)

It was found that the krb5_read_message() function of MIT Kerberos did
not correctly sanitize input, and could create invalid krb5_data
objects. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to
crash a Kerberos child process via a specially crafted request.
(CVE-2014-5355)

A double-free flaw was found in the way MIT Kerberos handled invalid
External Data Representation (XDR) data. An authenticated user could
use this flaw to crash the MIT Kerberos administration server
(kadmind), or other applications using Kerberos libraries, via
specially crafted XDR packets. (CVE-2014-9421)

It was found that the MIT Kerberos administration server (kadmind)
incorrectly accepted certain authentication requests for two-component
server principal names. A remote attacker able to acquire a key with a
particularly named principal (such as 'kad/x') could use this flaw to
impersonate any user to kadmind, and perform administrative actions as

This update also fixes the following bug :

* Previously, the nscd daemon did not properly reload modified data
when the user edited monitored nscd configuration files. As a
consequence, nscd returned stale data to system processes. This update
adds a system of inotify-based monitoring and stat-based backup
monitoring for nscd configuration files. As a result, nscd now detects
changes to its configuration files and reloads the data properly,
which prevents it from returning stale data. (BZ#1194149)

* A flaw was found in the way seunshare, a utility for running
executables under a different security context, used the capng_lock
functionality of the libcap-ng library. The subsequent invocation of
suid root binaries that relied on the fact that the setuid() system
call, among others, also sets the saved set-user-ID when dropping the
binaries' process privileges, could allow a local, unprivileged user
to potentially escalate their privileges on the system. Note: the fix
for this issue is the kernel part of the overall fix, and introduces
the PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS functionality and the related SELinux exec
transitions support. (CVE-2014-3215, Important)

* A use-after-free flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's SCTP
implementation handled authentication key reference counting during
INIT collisions. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the

Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to
support cross-platform development of security-enabled client and
server applications.

A flaw was found in the way the TLS protocol composes the
Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange. A man-in-the-middle attacker could

during the key exchange, allowing them do decrypt all traffic.
(CVE-2015-4000)

Note: This update forces the TLS/SSL client implementation in NSS to
reject DH key sizes below 768 bits, which prevents sessions to be
downgraded to export-grade keys. Future updates may raise this limit
to 1024 bits.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful,
efficient, and extensible web server.

A flaw was found in the way httpd handled HTTP Trailer headers when
processing requests using chunked encoding. A malicious client could
use Trailer headers to set additional HTTP headers after header
processing was performed by other modules. This could, for example,
lead to a bypass of header restrictions defined with mod_headers.
(CVE-2013-5704)

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* The order of mod_proxy workers was not checked when httpd
configuration was reloaded. When mod_proxy workers were removed,
added, or their order was changed, their parameters and scores could
become mixed. The order of mod_proxy workers has been made internally
consistent during configuration reload. (BZ#1149906)

* The local host certificate created during firstboot contained CA
extensions, which caused the httpd service to return warning messages.
This has been addressed by local host certificates being generated
with the '-extensions v3_req' option. (BZ#906476)

* The default mod_ssl configuration no longer enables support for SSL
cipher suites using the single DES, IDEA, or SEED encryption
algorithms. (BZ#1086771)

* The apachectl script did not take into account the HTTPD_LANG
variable set in the /etc/sysconfig/httpd file during graceful
restarts. Consequently, httpd did not use a changed value of
HTTPD_LANG when the daemon was restarted gracefully. The script has
been fixed to handle the HTTPD_LANG variable correctly. (BZ#963146)

* The mod_deflate module failed to check the original file size while
extracting files larger than 4 GB, making it impossible to extract
large files. Now, mod_deflate checks the original file size properly
according to RFC1952, and it is able to decompress files larger than 4
GB. (BZ#1057695)

* The httpd service did not check configuration before restart. When a
configuration contained an error, an attempt to restart httpd
gracefully failed. Now, httpd checks configuration before restart and
if the configuration is in an inconsistent state, an error message is
printed, httpd is not stopped and a restart is not performed.
(BZ#1146194)

* The SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY environment variable was incorrectly handled
when the 'SSLVerifyClient optional_no_ca' and 'SSLSessionCache'
options were used. When an SSL session was resumed, the
SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY value was set to 'SUCCESS' instead of the previously
set 'GENEROUS'. SSL_CLIENT_VERIFY is now correctly set to GENEROUS in
this scenario. (BZ#1149703)

* The ab utility did not correctly handle situations when an SSL
connection was closed after some data had already been read. As a
consequence, ab did not work correctly with SSL servers and printed
'SSL read failed' error messages. With this update, ab works as
expected with HTTPS servers. (BZ#1045477)

* When a client presented a revoked certificate, log entries were
created only at the debug level. The log level of messages regarding a
revoked certificate has been increased to INFO, and administrators are
now properly informed of this situation. (BZ#1161328)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancement :

* A mod_proxy worker can now be set into drain mode (N) using the
balancer-manager web interface or using the httpd configuration file.
A worker in drain mode accepts only existing sticky sessions destined
for itself and ignores all other requests. The worker waits until all
clients currently connected to this worker complete their work before
the worker is stopped. As a result, drain mode enables to perform
maintenance on a worker without affecting clients. (BZ#767130)

Users of httpd are advised to upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues and add this
enhancement. After installing the updated packages, the httpd service
will be restarted automatically.","Update the affected httpd packages.","http://www.nessus.org/u?2997bcaf","

The curl packages provide the libcurl library and the curl utility for
downloading files from servers using various protocols, including
HTTP, FTP, and LDAP.

It was found that the libcurl library did not correctly handle partial
literal IP addresses when parsing received HTTP cookies. An attacker
able to trick a user into connecting to a malicious server could use
this flaw to set the user's cookie to a crafted domain, making other
cookie-related issues easier to exploit. (CVE-2014-3613)

A flaw was found in the way the libcurl library performed the
duplication of connection handles. If an application set the
CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS option for a handle, using the handle's
duplicate could cause the application to crash or disclose a portion
of its memory. (CVE-2014-3707)

It was discovered that the libcurl library failed to properly handle
URLs with embedded end-of-line characters. An attacker able to make an
application using libcurl to access a specially crafted URL via an
HTTP proxy could use this flaw to inject additional headers to the
request or construct additional requests. (CVE-2014-8150)

It was discovered that libcurl implemented aspects of the NTLM and
Negotatiate authentication incorrectly. If an application uses libcurl
and the affected mechanisms in a specifc way, certain requests to a
previously NTLM-authenticated server could appears as sent by the
wrong authenticated user. Additionally, the initial set of credentials
for HTTP Negotiate-authenticated requests could be reused in
subsequent requests, although a different set of credentials was
specified. (CVE-2015-3143, CVE-2015-3148)

Red Hat would like to thank the cURL project for reporting these
issues.

Bug fixes :

* An out-of-protocol fallback to SSL version 3.0 (SSLv3.0) was
available with libcurl. Attackers could abuse the fallback to force
downgrade of the SSL version. The fallback has been removed from
libcurl. Users requiring this functionality can explicitly enable
SSLv3.0 through the libcurl API. (BZ#1154059)

* A single upload transfer through the FILE protocol opened the
destination file twice. If the inotify kernel subsystem monitored the
file, two events were produced unnecessarily. The file is now opened
only once per upload. (BZ#883002)

* Utilities using libcurl for SCP/SFTP transfers could terminate
unexpectedly when the system was running in FIPS mode. (BZ#1008178)

* Using the '--retry' option with the curl utility could cause curl to
terminate unexpectedly with a segmentation fault. Now, adding
'--retry' no longer causes curl to crash. (BZ#1009455)

* The 'curl --trace-time' command did not use the correct local time
when printing timestamps. Now, 'curl --trace-time' works as expected.
(BZ#1120196)

* The valgrind utility could report dynamically allocated memory leaks
on curl exit. Now, curl performs a global shutdown of the NetScape
Portable Runtime (NSPR) library on exit, and valgrind no longer
reports the memory leaks. (BZ#1146528)

* Previously, libcurl returned an incorrect value of the
CURLINFO_HEADER_SIZE field when a proxy server appended its own
headers to the HTTP response. Now, the returned value is valid.
(BZ#1161163)

Enhancements :

* The '--tlsv1.0', '--tlsv1.1', and '--tlsv1.2' options are available
for specifying the minor version of the TLS protocol to be negotiated
by NSS. The '--tlsv1' option now negotiates the highest version of the
TLS protocol supported by both the client and the server. (BZ#1012136)

* It is now possible to explicitly enable or disable the ECC and the
new AES cipher suites to be used for TLS. (BZ#1058767, BZ#1156422)

downloading files from servers using various protocols, including
HTTP, FTP, and LDAP.

It was found that the libcurl library did not correctly handle partial
literal IP addresses when parsing received HTTP cookies. An attacker
able to trick a user into connecting to a malicious server could use
this flaw to set the user's cookie to a crafted domain, making other
cookie-related issues easier to exploit. (CVE-2014-3613)

A flaw was found in the way the libcurl library performed the
duplication of connection handles. If an application set the
CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS option for a handle, using the handle's
duplicate could cause the application to crash or disclose a portion
of its memory. (CVE-2014-3707)

It was discovered that the libcurl library failed to properly handle
URLs with embedded end-of-line characters. An attacker able to make an
application using libcurl to access a specially crafted URL via an
HTTP proxy could use this flaw to inject additional headers to the
request or construct additional requests. (CVE-2014-8150)

It was discovered that libcurl implemented aspects of the NTLM and
Negotatiate authentication incorrectly. If an application uses libcurl
and the affected mechanisms in a specifc way, certain requests to a
previously NTLM-authenticated server could appears as sent by the
wrong authenticated user. Additionally, the initial set of credentials
for HTTP Negotiate-authenticated requests could be reused in
subsequent requests, although a different set of credentials was
specified. (CVE-2015-3143, CVE-2015-3148)

Red Hat would like to thank the cURL project for reporting these
issues.

Bug fixes :

* An out-of-protocol fallback to SSL version 3.0 (SSLv3.0) was
available with libcurl. Attackers could abuse the fallback to force
downgrade of the SSL version. The fallback has been removed from
libcurl. Users requiring this functionality can explicitly enable
SSLv3.0 through the libcurl API. (BZ#1154059)

* A single upload transfer through the FILE protocol opened the
destination file twice. If the inotify kernel subsystem monitored the
file, two events were produced unnecessarily. The file is now opened
only once per upload. (BZ#883002)

* Utilities using libcurl for SCP/SFTP transfers could terminate
unexpectedly when the system was running in FIPS mode. (BZ#1008178)

* Using the '--retry' option with the curl utility could cause curl to
terminate unexpectedly with a segmentation fault. Now, adding
'--retry' no longer causes curl to crash. (BZ#1009455)

* The 'curl --trace-time' command did not use the correct local time
when printing timestamps. Now, 'curl --trace-time' works as expected.
(BZ#1120196)

* The valgrind utility could report dynamically allocated memory leaks
on curl exit. Now, curl performs a global shutdown of the NetScape
Portable Runtime (NSPR) library on exit, and valgrind no longer
reports the memory leaks. (BZ#1146528)

* Previously, libcurl returned an incorrect value of the
CURLINFO_HEADER_SIZE field when a proxy server appended its own
headers to the HTTP response. Now, the returned value is valid.
(BZ#1161163)

Enhancements :

* The '--tlsv1.0', '--tlsv1.1', and '--tlsv1.2' options are available
for specifying the minor version of the TLS protocol to be negotiated
by NSS. The '--tlsv1' option now negotiates the highest version of the
TLS protocol supported by both the client and the server. (BZ#1012136)

* It is now possible to explicitly enable or disable the ECC and the
new AES cipher suites to be used for TLS. (BZ#1058767, BZ#1156422)

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

* A flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's Transparent Huge Pages

unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the kernel by migrating
transparent hugepages. (CVE-2014-3940, Moderate)

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's
eCryptfs implementation decoded encrypted file names. A local,
unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-9683,
Moderate)

* A race condition flaw was found between the chown and execve system
calls. When changing the owner of a setuid user binary to root, the
race condition could momentarily make the binary setuid root. A local,
unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their
privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-3339, Moderate)

* Multiple out-of-bounds write flaws were found in the way the Cherry
Cymotion keyboard driver, KYE/Genius device drivers, Logitech device
drivers, Monterey Genius KB29E keyboard driver, Petalynx Maxter remote
control driver, and Sunplus wireless desktop driver handled HID
reports with an invalid report descriptor size. An attacker with
physical access to the system could use either of these flaws to write
data past an allocated memory buffer. (CVE-2014-3184, Low)

* An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) implementation handled access
of the user control's state. A local, privileged user could use this
flaw to leak kernel memory to user space. (CVE-2014-4652, Low)

* It was found that the espfix functionality could be bypassed by
installing a 16-bit RW data segment into GDT instead of LDT (which
espfix checks), and using that segment on the stack. A local,
unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to leak kernel stack
addresses. (CVE-2014-8133, Low)

* An information leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's IEEE 802.11
wireless networking implementation. When software encryption was used,
a remote attacker could use this flaw to leak up to 8 bytes of
plaintext. (CVE-2014-8709, Low)

* It was found that the Linux kernel KVM subsystem's sysenter
instruction emulation was not sufficient. An unprivileged guest user
could use this flaw to escalate their privileges by tricking the
hypervisor to emulate a SYSENTER instruction in 16-bit mode, if the
guest OS did not initialize the SYSENTER model-specific registers

* A flaw was found in the way Linux kernel's Transparent Huge Pages
(THP) implementation handled non-huge page migration. A local,
unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the kernel by migrating
transparent hugepages. (CVE-2014-3940, Moderate)

* A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's
eCryptfs implementation decoded encrypted file names. A local,
unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the system or,
potentially, escalate their privileges on the system. (CVE-2014-9683,
Moderate)

* A race condition flaw was found between the chown and execve system
calls. When changing the owner of a setuid user binary to root, the
race condition could momentarily make the binary setuid root. A local,
unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to escalate their
privileges on the system. (CVE-2015-3339, Moderate)

* Multiple out-of-bounds write flaws were found in the way the Cherry
Cymotion keyboard driver, KYE/Genius device drivers, Logitech device
drivers, Monterey Genius KB29E keyboard driver, Petalynx Maxter remote
control driver, and Sunplus wireless desktop driver handled HID
reports with an invalid report descriptor size. An attacker with
physical access to the system could use either of these flaws to write
data past an allocated memory buffer. (CVE-2014-3184, Low)

* An information leak flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) implementation handled access
of the user control's state. A local, privileged user could use this
flaw to leak kernel memory to user space. (CVE-2014-4652, Low)

* It was found that the espfix functionality could be bypassed by
installing a 16-bit RW data segment into GDT instead of LDT (which
espfix checks), and using that segment on the stack. A local,
unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to leak kernel stack
addresses. (CVE-2014-8133, Low)

* An information leak flaw was found in the Linux kernel's IEEE 802.11
wireless networking implementation. When software encryption was used,
a remote attacker could use this flaw to leak up to 8 bytes of
plaintext. (CVE-2014-8709, Low)

* It was found that the Linux kernel KVM subsystem's sysenter
instruction emulation was not sufficient. An unprivileged guest user
could use this flaw to escalate their privileges by tricking the
hypervisor to emulate a SYSENTER instruction in 16-bit mode, if the
guest OS did not initialize the SYSENTER model-specific registers
(MSRs). Note: Certified guest operating systems for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux with KVM do initialize the SYSENTER MSRs and are thus not
vulnerable to this issue when running on a KVM hypervisor.

are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate
security impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base
score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the
CVE link in the References section.

The net-snmp packages provide various libraries and tools for the
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), including an SNMP library,
an extensible agent, tools for requesting or setting information from
SNMP agents, tools for generating and handling SNMP traps, a version
of the netstat command which uses SNMP, and a Tk/Perl Management
Information Base (MIB) browser.

A denial of service flaw was found in the way snmptrapd handled
certain SNMP traps when started with the '-OQ' option. If an attacker
sent an SNMP trap containing a variable with a NULL type where an
integer variable type was expected, it would cause snmptrapd to crash.
(CVE-2014-3565)

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* The HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSystemProcesses object was not implemented
because parts of the HOST-RESOURCES-MIB module were rewritten in an
earlier version of net-snmp. Consequently,
HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSystemProcesses did not provide information on
the number of currently loaded or running processes. With this update,
HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrSystemProcesses has been implemented, and the
net-snmp daemon reports as expected. (BZ#1134335)

* The Net-SNMP agent daemon, snmpd, reloaded the system ARP table
every 60 seconds. As a consequence, snmpd could cause a short CPU
usage spike on busy systems with a large APR table. With this update,
snmpd does not reload the full ARP table periodically, but monitors
the table changes using a netlink socket. (BZ#789500)

* Previously, snmpd used an invalid pointer to the current time when
periodically checking certain conditions specified by the 'monitor'
option in the /etc/snmpd/snmpd.conf file. Consequently, snmpd
terminated unexpectedly on start with a segmentation fault if a
certain entry with the 'monitor' option was used. Now, snmpd
initializes the correct pointer to the current time, and snmpd no
longer crashes on start. (BZ#1050970)

* Previously, snmpd expected 8-bit network interface indices when
processing HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrDeviceTable. If an interface index of
a local network interface was larger than 30,000 items, snmpd could
terminate unexpectedly due to accessing invalid memory. Now,
processing of all network sizes is enabled, and snmpd no longer
crashes in the described situation. (BZ#1195547)

* The snmpdtrapd service incorrectly checked for errors when
forwarding a trap with a RequestID value of 0, and logged 'Forward
failed' even though the trap was successfully forwarded. This update
fixes snmptrapd checks and the aforementioned message is now logged
only when appropriate. (BZ#1146948)

* Previously, snmpd ignored the value of the 'storageUseNFS' option in
the /etc/snmpd/snmpd.conf file. As a consequence, NFS drivers were
shown as 'Network Disks', even though 'storageUseNFS' was set to '2'
to report them as 'Fixed Disks' in HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrStorageTable.
With this update, snmpd takes the 'storageUseNFS' option value into
account, and 'Fixed Disks' NFS drives are reported correctly.
(BZ#1125793)

* Previously, the Net-SNMP python binding used an incorrect size (8
bytes instead of 4) for variables of IPADDRESS type. Consequently,
applications that were using Net-SNMP Python bindings could send
malformed SNMP messages. With this update, the bindings now use 4
bytes for variables with IPADRESS type, and only valid SNMP messages
are sent. (BZ#1100099)

* Previously, the snmpd service did not cut values in
HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrStorageTable to signed 32-bit integers, as
required by SNMP standards, and provided the values as unsigned
integers. As a consequence, the HOST-RESOURCES-MIB::hrStorageTable
implementation did not conform to RFC 2790. The values are now cut to
32-bit signed integers, and snmpd is therefore standard compliant.

The sudo packages contain the sudo utility which allows system
administrators to provide certain users with the permission to execute
privileged commands, which are used for system management purposes,
without having to log in as root.

It was discovered that sudo did not perform any checks of the TZ
environment variable value. If sudo was configured to preserve the TZ
environment variable, a local user with privileges to execute commands
via sudo could possibly use this flaw to achieve system state changes
not permitted by the configured commands. (CVE-2014-9680)

Note: The default sudoers configuration in Red Hat Enterprise Linux
removes the TZ variable from the environment in which commands run by
sudo are executed.

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* Previously, the sudo utility child processes could sometimes become
unresponsive because they ignored the SIGPIPE signal. With this
update, SIGPIPE handler is properly restored in the function that
reads passwords from the user, and the child processes no longer
ignore SIGPIPE. As a result, sudo child processes do not hang in this
situation. (BZ#1094548)

* Prior to this update, the order in which sudo rules were processed
did not honor the user-defined sudoOrder attribute. Consequently, sudo
rules were processed in an undefined order even when the user defined
the order in sudoOrder. The implementation of SSSD support in sudo has
been modified to sort the rules according to the sudoOrder value, and
sudo rules are now sorted in the order defined by the user in
sudoOrder. (BZ#1138581)

* Previously, sudo became unresponsive after the user issued a command
when a sudoers source was mentioned multiple times in the
/etc/nsswitch.conf file. The problem occurred when nsswitch.conf
contained, for example, the 'sudoers: files sss sss' entry. The
sudoers source processing code has been fixed to correctly handle
multiple instances of the same sudoers source. As a result, sudo no
longer hangs when a sudoers source is mentioned multiple times in
/etc/nsswitch.conf. (BZ#1147498)

In addition, this update adds the following enhancement :

* The sudo utility now supports I/O logs compressed using the zlib
library. With this update, sudo can generate zlib compressed I/O logs
and also process zlib compressed I/O logs generated by other versions
of sudo with zlib support. (BZ#1106433)

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Low security
impact. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which
gives a detailed severity rating, is available from the CVE link in
the References section.

The wpa_supplicant package contains an 802.1X Supplicant with support
for WEP, WPA, WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i / RSN), and various EAP
authentication methods. It implements key negotiation with a WPA
Authenticator for client stations and controls the roaming and IEEE
802.11 authentication and association of the WLAN driver.

An integer underflow flaw, leading to a buffer over-read, was found in
the way wpa_supplicant handled WMM Action frames. A specially crafted
frame could possibly allow an attacker within Wi-Fi radio range to
cause wpa_supplicant to crash. (CVE-2015-4142)

This update includes the following enhancement :

* Prior to this update, wpa_supplicant did not provide a way to
require the host name to be listed in an X.509 certificate's Common
Name or Subject Alternative Name, and only allowed host name suffix or
subject substring checks. This update introduces a new configuration
directive, 'domain_match', which adds a full host name check.
(BZ#1186806)

All wpa_supplicant users are advised to upgrade to this updated
package, which contains a backported patch to correct this issue and
adds this enhancement. After installing this update, the
wpa_supplicant service will be restarted automatically.","Update the affected wpa_supplicant package.","http://www.nessus.org/u?1fb98753","

The grep utility searches through textual input for lines that contain
a match to a specified pattern and then prints the matching lines. The
GNU grep utilities include grep, egrep, and fgrep.

An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the way grep parsed large lines of data. An attacker able to
trick a user into running grep on a specially crafted data file could
use this flaw to crash grep or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running grep. (CVE-2012-5667)

A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way grep processed
certain pattern and text combinations. An attacker able to trick a
user into running grep on specially crafted input could use this flaw
to crash grep or, potentially, read from uninitialized memory.
(CVE-2015-1345)

The grep packages have been upgraded to upstream version 2.20, which
provides a number of bug fixes and enhancements over the previous
version. Notably, the speed of various operations has been improved
significantly. Now, the recursive grep utility uses the fts function
of the gnulib library for directory traversal, so that it can handle
much larger directories without reporting the 'File name too long'
error message, and it can operate faster when dealing with large
directory hierarchies. (BZ#982215, BZ#1064668, BZ#1126757, BZ#1167766,
BZ#1171806)

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* Prior to this update, the \w and \W symbols were inconsistently
matched to the [:alnum:] character class. Consequently, regular
expressions that used \ w and \W in some cases had incorrect results.
An upstream patch which fixes the matching problem has been applied,
and \w is now matched to the [_[:alnum:]] character and \W to the
[^_[:alnum:]] character consistently. (BZ#799863)

* Previously, the '--fixed-regexp' command-line option was not
included in the grep(1) manual page. Consequently, the manual page was
inconsistent with the built-in help of the grep utility. To fix this
bug, grep(1) has been updated to include a note informing the user
that '--fixed-regexp' is an obsolete option. Now, the built-in help
and manual page are consistent regarding the '--fixed-regexp' option.
(BZ#1103270)

* Previously, the Perl Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library
did not work correctly when matching non-UTF-8 text in UTF-8 mode.
Consequently, an error message about invalid UTF-8 byte sequence
characters was returned. To fix this bug, patches from upstream have
been applied to the PCRE library and the grep utility. As a result,

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's

malicious control and configuration packets by spoofing ::1 addresses.
(CVE-2014-9298)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way NTP hosts that were

host, which could cascade to other peers, and stop the synchronization
process among the reached peers. (CVE-2015-1799)

A flaw was found in the way the ntp-keygen utility generated MD5
symmetric keys on big-endian systems. An attacker could possibly use
this flaw to guess generated MD5 keys, which could then be used to
spoof an NTP client or server. (CVE-2015-3405)

A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way the NTP autokey
protocol was implemented. When an NTP client decrypted a secret
received from an NTP server, it could cause that client to crash.
(CVE-2014-9297)

It was found that ntpd did not check whether a Message Authentication
Code (MAC) was present in a received packet when ntpd was configured
to use symmetric cryptographic keys. A man-in-the-middle attacker
could use this flaw to send crafted packets that would be accepted by
a client or a peer without the attacker knowing the symmetric key.
(CVE-2015-1798)

The CVE-2015-1798 and CVE-2015-1799 issues were discovered by Miroslav
Lichvár of Red Hat.

Bug fixes :

* The ntpd daemon truncated symmetric keys specified in the key file
to 20 bytes. As a consequence, it was impossible to configure NTP
authentication to work with peers that use longer keys. The maximum
length of keys has now been changed to 32 bytes. (BZ#1053551)

* The ntp-keygen utility used the exponent of 3 when generating RSA
keys, and generating RSA keys failed when FIPS mode was enabled.
ntp-keygen has been modified to use the exponent of 65537, and
generating keys in FIPS mode now works as expected. (BZ#1184421)

* The ntpd daemon included a root delay when calculating its root
dispersion. Consequently, the NTP server reported larger root
dispersion than it should have and clients could reject the source
when its distance reached the maximum synchronization distance (1.5
seconds by default). Calculation of root dispersion has been fixed,
the root dispersion is now reported correctly, and clients no longer
reject the server due to a large synchronization distance.
(BZ#1045376)

* The ntpd daemon dropped incoming NTP packets if their source port
was lower than 123 (the NTP port). Clients behind Network Address
Translation (NAT) were unable to synchronize with the server if their
source port was translated to ports below 123. With this update, ntpd
no longer checks the source port number. (BZ#1171630)

Enhancements :

* This update introduces configurable access of memory segments used
for Shared Memory Driver (SHM) reference clocks. Previously, only the
first two memory segments were created with owner-only access,
allowing just two SHM reference clocks to be used securely on a
system. Now, the owner-only access to SHM is configurable with the
'mode' option, and it is therefore possible to use more SHM reference
clocks securely. (BZ#1122015)

* Support for nanosecond resolution has been added to the SHM
reference clock. Prior to this update, when a Precision Time Protocol
(PTP) hardware clock was used as a time source to synchronize the
system clock (for example, with the timemaster service from the
linuxptp package), the accuracy of the synchronization was limited due
to the microsecond resolution of the SHM protocol. The nanosecond

(BZ#1045376)

* The ntpd daemon dropped incoming NTP packets if their source port
was lower than 123 (the NTP port). Clients behind Network Address
Translation (NAT) were unable to synchronize with the server if their
source port was translated to ports below 123. With this update, ntpd
no longer checks the source port number. (BZ#1171630)

Enhancements :

* This update introduces configurable access of memory segments used
for Shared Memory Driver (SHM) reference clocks. Previously, only the
first two memory segments were created with owner-only access,
allowing just two SHM reference clocks to be used securely on a
system. Now, the owner-only access to SHM is configurable with the
'mode' option, and it is therefore possible to use more SHM reference
clocks securely. (BZ#1122015)

* Support for nanosecond resolution has been added to the SHM
reference clock. Prior to this update, when a Precision Time Protocol
(PTP) hardware clock was used as a time source to synchronize the
system clock (for example, with the timemaster service from the
linuxptp package), the accuracy of the synchronization was limited due
to the microsecond resolution of the SHM protocol. The nanosecond
extension in the SHM protocol now enables sub-microsecond
synchronization of the system clock. (BZ#1117704)","Update the affected ntp packages.","http://www.nessus.org/u?6834dff9","

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having Moderate

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is used to synchronize a computer's
time with another referenced time source.

It was found that because NTP's access control was based on a source
IP address, an attacker could bypass source IP restrictions and send
malicious control and configuration packets by spoofing ::1 addresses.
(CVE-2014-9298)

A denial of service flaw was found in the way NTP hosts that were
peering with each other authenticated themselves before updating their
internal state variables. An attacker could send packets to one peer
host, which could cascade to other peers, and stop the synchronization
process among the reached peers. (CVE-2015-1799)

A flaw was found in the way the ntp-keygen utility generated MD5
symmetric keys on big-endian systems. An attacker could possibly use
this flaw to guess generated MD5 keys, which could then be used to
spoof an NTP client or server. (CVE-2015-3405)

A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the way the NTP autokey
protocol was implemented. When an NTP client decrypted a secret
received from an NTP server, it could cause that client to crash.
(CVE-2014-9297)

It was found that ntpd did not check whether a Message Authentication
Code (MAC) was present in a received packet when ntpd was configured
to use symmetric cryptographic keys. A man-in-the-middle attacker
could use this flaw to send crafted packets that would be accepted by
a client or a peer without the attacker knowing the symmetric key.
(CVE-2015-1798)

The CVE-2015-1798 and CVE-2015-1799 issues were discovered by Miroslav
Lichvár of Red Hat.

Bug fixes :

* The ntpd daemon truncated symmetric keys specified in the key file
to 20 bytes. As a consequence, it was impossible to configure NTP
authentication to work with peers that use longer keys. The maximum
length of keys has now been changed to 32 bytes. (BZ#1053551)

* The ntp-keygen utility used the exponent of 3 when generating RSA
keys, and generating RSA keys failed when FIPS mode was enabled.
ntp-keygen has been modified to use the exponent of 65537, and
generating keys in FIPS mode now works as expected. (BZ#1184421)

* The ntpd daemon included a root delay when calculating its root
dispersion. Consequently, the NTP server reported larger root
dispersion than it should have and clients could reject the source
when its distance reached the maximum synchronization distance (1.5
seconds by default). Calculation of root dispersion has been fixed,
the root dispersion is now reported correctly, and clients no longer
reject the server due to a large synchronization distance.

Wireshark, previously known as Ethereal, is a network protocol

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* Previously, the Wireshark tool did not support Advanced Encryption
Standard Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM) cryptographic algorithm. As a
consequence, AES-GCM was not decrypted. Support for AES-GCM has been
added to Wireshark, and AES-GCM is now correctly decrypted.
(BZ#1095065)

The kernel packages contain the Linux kernel, the core of any Linux
operating system.

Two flaws were found in the way the Linux kernel's networking
implementation handled UDP packets with incorrect checksum values. A
remote attacker could potentially use these flaws to trigger an
infinite loop in the kernel, resulting in a denial of service on the
system, or cause a denial of service in applications using the edge
triggered epoll functionality. (CVE-2015-5364, CVE-2015-5366,
Important)

This update also fixes the following bugs :

* When removing a directory, and a reference was held to that
directory by a reference to a negative child dentry, the directory
dentry was previously not killed. In addition, once the negative child
dentry was killed, an unlinked and unused dentry was present in the
cache. As a consequence, deadlock could be caused by forcing the
dentry eviction while the file system in question was frozen. With
this update, all unused dentries are unhashed and evicted just after a
successful directory removal, which avoids the deadlock, and the
system no longer hangs in the aforementioned scenario. (BZ#1243400)

* Due to the broken s_umount lock ordering, a race condition occurred
when an unlinked file was closed and the sync (or syncfs) utility was
run at the same time. As a consequence, deadlock occurred on a frozen
file system between sync and a process trying to unfreeze the file
system. With this update, sync (or syncfs) is skipped on a frozen file
system, and deadlock no longer occurs in the aforementioned situation.
(BZ#1243404)

* Previously, in the scenario when a file was opened by file handle
(fhandle) with its dentry not present in dcache ('cold dcache') and
then making use of the unlink() and close() functions, the inode was
not freed upon the close() system call. As a consequence, the iput()
final was delayed indefinitely. A patch has been provided to fix this
bug, and the inode is now freed as expected. (BZ#1243406)

* Due to a corrupted Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) header in
the /proc/vmcore file, the kdump utility failed to provide any
information. The underlying source code has been patched, and kdump
now provides debuging information for kernel crashes as intended.
(BZ#1245195)

* Previously, running the multipath request queue caused regressions
in cases where paths failed regularly under I/O load. This regression
manifested as I/O stalls that exceeded 300 seconds. This update
reverts the changes aimed to reduce running the multipath request
queue resulting in I/O stalls completing in a timely manner.

vulnerability from the CVE links in the References section.

Subversion (SVN) is a concurrent version control system which enables
one or more users to collaborate in developing and maintaining a
hierarchy of files and directories while keeping a history of all
changes. The mod_dav_svn module is used with the Apache HTTP Server to
allow access to Subversion repositories via HTTP.

An assertion failure flaw was found in the way the SVN server
processed certain requests with dynamically evaluated revision
numbers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause the SVN server
(both svnserve and httpd with the mod_dav_svn module) to crash.
(CVE-2015-0248)

It was found that the mod_dav_svn module did not properly validate the
svn:author property of certain requests. An attacker able to create
new revisions could use this flaw to spoof the svn:author property.
(CVE-2015-0251)

It was found that when an SVN server (both svnserve and httpd with the
mod_dav_svn module) searched the history of a file or a directory, it
would disclose its location in the repository if that file or
directory was not readable (for example, if it had been moved).
(CVE-2015-3187)

Red Hat would like to thank the Apache Software Foundation for
reporting these issues. Upstream acknowledges Evgeny Kotkov of
VisualSVN as the original reporter of CVE-2015-0248 and CVE-2015-0251,
and C. Michael Pilato of CollabNet as the original reporter of
CVE-2015-3187.

All subversion users should upgrade to these updated packages, which
contain backported patches to correct these issues. After installing
the updated packages, for the update to take effect, you must restart
the httpd daemon, if you are using mod_dav_svn, and the svnserve
daemon, if you are serving Subversion repositories via the svn://
protocol.","Update the affected subversion packages.","http://www.nessus.org/u?89ef1677","

SQLite is a C library that implements a SQL database engine. A large
subset of SQL92 is supported. A complete database is stored in a
single disk file. The API is designed for convenience and ease of use.
Applications that link against SQLite can enjoy the power and
flexibility of a SQL database without the administrative hassles of
supporting a separate database server.

It was found that SQLite's sqlite3VXPrintf() function did not properly
handle precision and width values during floating-point conversions. A
local attacker could submit a specially crafted SELECT statement that
would crash the SQLite process, or have other unspecified impacts.

The net-snmp packages provide various libraries and tools for the
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), including an SNMP library,
an extensible agent, tools for requesting or setting information from
SNMP agents, tools for generating and handling SNMP traps, a version
of the netstat command which uses SNMP, and a Tk/Perl Management
Information Base (MIB) browser.

It was discovered that the snmp_pdu_parse() function could leave
incompletely parsed varBind variables in the list of variables. A
remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash snmpd
or, potentially, execute arbitrary code on the system with the
privileges of the user running snmpd. (CVE-2015-5621)

Red Hat would like to thank Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 company, China

Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) provide a system whereby
administrators can set up authentication policies without having to
recompile programs to handle authentication.

It was discovered that the _unix_run_helper_binary() function of PAM's
unix_pam module could write to a blocking pipe, possibly causing the
function to become unresponsive. An attacker able to supply large
passwords to the unix_pam module could use this flaw to enumerate
valid user accounts, or cause a denial of service on the system.

The httpd packages provide the Apache HTTP Server, a powerful,
efficient, and extensible web server.

Multiple flaws were found in the way httpd parsed HTTP requests and
responses using chunked transfer encoding. A remote attacker could use
these flaws to create a specially crafted request, which httpd would
decode differently from an HTTP proxy software in front of it,
possibly leading to HTTP request smuggling attacks. (CVE-2015-3183)
